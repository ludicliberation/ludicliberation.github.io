**Ludic Liberation Lab** is a project to explore transformative and political game design, game-based pedagogy, and playful facilitation techniques. We gather together to play and learn from a variety of board, tabletop and card games, participatory simulations, war games, and pervasive and immersive game experiences as tools for political education and social change. Meetings include collective play, exploration of game mechanics and facilitation strategies, and collaborative design activities. 

**Ludic Liberation Lab** meets every first Wednesday of the month at Incite Seminars HQ, at The Bourse (111 S. Independence Mall, Philadelphia). $15 suggested donation pays for space, snacks, and materials.
